# cellphone-activity-for-work-r-project

This is my project for the "Statistics and Empirical Methods" course at FMI, Sofia University, written in R.
Here you can find:
- a .csv file w/ data (according to a quick survey that a group of 25 people filled out) that I used analysis purposes;
- the .R file with the full code including comments telling what is what and how it's all happening;
- a PDF documentation including a detailed information of each part of the R code.
